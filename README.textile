h3. About

Illuminati is a set of tools geared towards automating portions of Illumina's secondary analysis pipeline. This application is custom tailored for a specific research institution and not architectured for general use. This may change in the future, and others dealing with Illumina software could still find it interesting.

Note: we will refer to this pipeline as the 'primary' analysis pipeline, even though Illumina documentation refers to it as the 'secondary' analysis pipeline.

h3. What it does

General overview of the execution of the analysis pipeline this tool performs:

* Create configuration files
** SampleSheet.csv and config.txt are created using data from custom LIMS system
* Convert raw unaligned reads to Fastq format
* Demultiplex indexed lanes
* Perform alignment to reference genome
* Aggregate and rename unaligned reads
* Remove reads that do not pass filter
* Analyze unaligned reads using fastqc
* Aggregate and rename export files
* Distribute data to project directories
* Distribute stats and quality control analysis to qcdata directory

h3. Requirements

* *CASAVA 1.8.0* - this tool is primarily a wrapper around the CASAVA pipeline software help automate it. This tool is designed to deal specifically with CASAVA 1.8, and would fail completely with an older version. CASAVA binaries should be located at @CASAVA_PATH@ (see @lib/illuminati/constants.rb@).
* *fastqc* - we need fastqc available from the command line. Tested with fastqc version *0.9.2*.
* *ngsquery.pl* - the most troublesome external dependency. ngsquery.pl should sit in the @SCRIPT_PATH@ directory. It is a perl script that connects to our LIMS system and provides flowcell and distribution information back to Illuminati. Future work will be to eliminate or reduce this external dependency. 

* *fastqc.pl* - another external perl script. This one automates the running of fastqc and a bit of post processing to make convenient, easy to read, centralized output. Future work includes rewriting this script in ruby for fun and including it in Illuminati.
