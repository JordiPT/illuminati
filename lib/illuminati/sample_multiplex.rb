  #
  # Interface between SampleMultiplex.csv file and Illuminati.
  # Finds and reads SampleMultiplex.csv file for flowcell and
  # translates it into an array of hash values.

  class SampleMultiplex
    #
    # Main interface between SampleMultiplex and rest of Illuminati.
    # Given a starting path, find will look for SampleMultiplex.csv files
    # and parse them.
    #
    # == Parameters:
    # base_dir::
    #   Directory that SampleMultiplex.csv should be in.
    #
    # == Returns:
    # Array of hash values for each sample found in SampleMultiplex.csv file.
    # Content of this hash includes:
    #   :lane - lane number.
    #   :name - sample name.
    #   :illumina_barcode - TruSeq index if provided.
    #   :custom_barcode - Custom barcode sequence, if provided.
    # Missing values are nil.
    # If no SampleMultiplex.csv is found, an empty array is returned.
